This is a comment website focusing on web security and a bit of design.

## Website
<https://cards.fluffy-pony.com/allcards>

## Description
This project is designed on the separation of front-end and back-end.  
It used __Vue__ as its front-end, and __PHP__ (Rest API) as its back-end.  
This website is mainly focusing on __web security__. Like preventing XSS, CSRF, etc.  
But I also try to do some design from scratch, to Figma, to implementing it with Vue.
